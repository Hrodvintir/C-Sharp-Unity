# Exercise 2: If and Switch Statements

Although this exercise isn't worth any points, it gives you valuable programming experience. You're almost definitely going to have to complete the exercises to succeed in the course.

### Problem 1 - Create and use a menu using an if statement

Start up Visual Studio and create a new Console Application project named Exercise2. Save the project in a reasonable location on the computer.

Create a menu of choices for your user. It should look like the following (without the extra blank lines):
```c#
**************

Menu:

1 - New Game

2 - Load Game

3 - Options

4 - Quit

**************
```
You should then prompt for and read in the user’s choice as an integer.

Your application should print an appropriate response confirming their choice, such as:

Loading game ...

To summarize, your application should:

·        Display the menu

·        Prompt for and read in the user’s choice

·        Store the choice in an appropriate variable

·        Using an if statement, determine which menu option the user selected, printing an appropriate message for the option selected

·        If the user enters something other than a menu option, print an appropriate message

### Problem 2 - Use a switch statement

·        Using a switch statement, determine which menu option the user selected, printing an appropriate message for the option selected

·        If the user enters something other than a menu option, print an appropriate message

Put your switch statement directly below the if statement in the code so that your response to the user looks like it’s repeated.
