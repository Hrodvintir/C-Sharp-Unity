# Exercise 5: Mouse Jumping

Although this exercise isn't worth any points, it gives you valuable programming experience. You're almost definitely going to have to complete the exercises to succeed in the course.

### Problem 1 - Create a project and add a sprite

Create a new 2D Unity project named Exercise5. Rename the SampleScene as Scene0. Add a new Sprites folder and use your Operating System to copy a sprite of your choosing into that folder. Drag the sprite into the Hierarchy window to create a game object in the scene. Run the game and watch nothing happen.

### Problem 2 - Write the code

Create a new Scripts folder and create a new C# script in that folder called Jumper. Open the new script in Visual Studio and add a documentation comment for the class. The Jumper class (script) jumps the game object to the mouse location when the left mouse button is pressed.

Delete the Start method from the script. Add code to the body of the Update method to implement the required behavior. The Mouse Button Processing lecture covers mouse button input processing in detail.

### Problem 3 - Finish the game

Run the game to make sure it works properly. Swear because you didn't attach the script to anything.

Attach the script to your sprite game object and run the game again. Debug as necessary.
