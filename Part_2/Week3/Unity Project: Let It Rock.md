# Unity Project: Let It Rock

### Unity Projects

In previous versions of this course, this Unity project was a required, graded, peer reviewed assignment. Unfortunately, the peer review process became unworkable for this project.  

I strongly encourage you to complete this project. It gives you good experience developing a Unity game using the concepts youâ€™ve learned in this and previous modules (and courses).

### Project Description  

You've decided to continue building the simplified version of the classic arcade game Asteroids that we started in the previous week. You won't actually complete the full version of the game until the beginning of the next course, but game developers typically break their game development into a number of increments. This project is the second increment in your development of this game.

In this project, you'll implement a moving asteroid for the game, including screen wrapping.

### Why do we care?

Because it's cool to actually build a real game, even a simple one! This project is the second increment in your implementation of a simplified version of Asteroids.

### Starting the Assignment

Download the zip file below and unzip the file somewhere on your computer.

*Let It Rock Unity Project Materials*

The zip file contains a number of useful materials, including my Asteroids project with the solution to the previous increment.

### Implementation Steps

I've provided detailed step-by-step instructions in the zip file above for you to follow if you'd like to have a "guided development experience" for this project.

Of course, you're also welcome to implement your solution without following those instructions, but you still need to implement all the required functionality for the project. Specifically, your solution needs to:

Include a moving asteroid in your game that starts moving in a random direction with one of 3 random sprites

Screen wrap the asteroid. For example, when the asteroid leaves the bottom of the game window it should re-appear at the top of the game window

### Screen Wrapping

Caution: Even if the screen wrapping is working properly, so a player could play the built game and screen wrapping would work perfectly, it may not seem to be working in the Unity Editor. The best thing to do is to build the game and play the built game. If, however, you want to just stay in the editor, double click the Main Camera in the Hierarchy window, then use Ctrl + Middle Mouse Wheel to zoom in on the Scene view until the box that shows the edges of the camera view just disappears from view.

### Testing Your Game

Here are the rubrics we used in previous versions of the course to confirm that the game functioned correctly:

1. Asteroid is in the scene when the game starts

2. Asteroid starts moving in a random direction

3. Asteroid is one of 3 random sprites (you'll have to play the game multiple times to check this)

4. The asteroid screen wraps properly. Wrapping should work correctly for the left, right, top, and bottom sides as well as all four corners.

5. The ship screen wraps properly. Wrapping should work correctly for the left, right, top, and bottom sides as well as all four corners.
