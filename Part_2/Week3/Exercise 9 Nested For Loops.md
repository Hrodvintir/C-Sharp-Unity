# Exercise 9 Nested For Loops
Although this exercise isn't worth any points, it gives you valuable programming experience. You're almost definitely going to have to complete the exercises to succeed in the course.

### Problem 1 – Print rows of asterisks that are a user-specified width

Create a new Console Application named Exercise9.

Prompt for and get a row width from the user.

Prompt for and get a number of rows from the user.

Print the appropriate number of rows of asterisks, with each row the user-specified row width.

For example, if the user enters 3 for the number of rows and 5 for the row width, your program should output:
```
*****

*****

*****
```
Note: The Coursera formatting makes it look like there's a blank line between each row of asterisks above, but there isn't. Your output for the given example should be exactly 3 lines of asterisks of width 5.

Hint: You need to use nested loops in your solution

### Problem 2 – Print rows of asterisks up to user-specified max width

Prompt for and get a row width from the user.

Print rows of asterisks, adding 1 to the asterisk in each row, until you print a row of the user-specified row width.

For example, if the user enters 5 your program should output:
```
*

**

***

****

*****
```
Note: The Coursera formatting makes it look like there's a blank line between each row of asterisks above, but there isn't. Your output for the given example should be exactly 5 lines of asterisks.
