# Exercise 14: For and Foreach Loops

Although this exercise isn't worth any points, it gives you valuable programming experience. You're almost definitely going to have to complete the exercises to succeed in the course.

### Getting Started

Download the zip file below and unzip the file somewhere on your computer. 

*Exercise 14 Materials*

Double-click the index file in the Help folder and click the ConsoleCards link in the pane on the left; this is the documentation for the classes I provided to you in the ConsoleCards dll.

### Problem 1 - Create objects

Follow the instructions from the Lecture Resources for the Adding a DLL lecture from last week to add the ConsoleCards.dll from the zip file as a reference for your project.

Inside the Main method, declare a deck variable and create a new Deck object for that variable.

Inside the Main method, declare a list variable that will hold a hand of cards and create a new list object for that variable.

Tell the deck to shuffle itself.

### Problem 2 - Deal and print the cards in a hand using for and foreach loops

Use a for loop to deal 5 cards from the deck to the hand

Use a foreach loop to flip all the cards in the hand over. Do NOT hard-code 5 as the upper limit of the loop.

Use a foreach loop (not a for loop) to print all the cards in the hand (remember, the Card class exposes a Print method).
