# Unity Project: Asteroid Spawning and Death

### Unity Projects

In previous versions of this course, this Unity project was a required, graded, peer reviewed assignment. Unfortunately, the peer review process became unworkable for this project.  

I strongly encourage you to complete this project. It gives you good experience developing a Unity game using the concepts youâ€™ve learned in this and previous modules (and courses).

### Project Description

You're still building the simplified version of the classic arcade game Asteroids. You won't actually complete the full version of the game until the next course, but game developers typically break their game development into a number of increments. This project is the third increment in your development of this game.

In this project, you'll implement asteroid spawning and collisions between the ship and asteroids.

### Why do we care?

Because it's cool to actually build a real game, even a simple one! This project is the third increment in your implementation of a simplified version of Asteroids.

### Starting the Assignment

Download the zip file below and unzip the file somewhere on your computer.

*Asteroid Spawning and Death Unity Project Materials*

The zip file contains a number of useful materials.

### Implementation Steps

I used my solution to the Unity project from the previous module as my starting point for this project; I've included that solution in the zip file above.

I've provided detailed step-by-step instructions in the zip file above for you to follow if you'd like to have a "guided development experience" for this project.

Of course, you're also welcome to implement your solution without following those instructions, but you still need to implement all the required functionality for the project. Specifically, your solution needs to:

Spawn 4 asteroids that move into the screen from the middle of the top, bottom, left, and right sides

Make sure the asteroids don't collide with each other but do collide with the ship

Destroy the ship when it collides with an asteroid

### Testing Your Game

Here are the rubrics we used in previous versions of the course to confirm that the game functioned correctly:

Asteroids enter the screen from around the middle of all 4 side

Asteroids are moving into the screen as they enter the screen

Asteroids don't collide with asteroids

Asteroids collide with the ship

The ship disappears when it collides with an asteroid
