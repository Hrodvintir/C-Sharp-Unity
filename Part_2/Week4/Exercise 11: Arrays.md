# Exercise 11: Arrays

Although this exercise isn't worth any points, it gives you valuable programming experience. You're almost definitely going to have to complete the exercises to succeed in the course.

### Getting Started

Download the zip file below and unzip the file somewhere on your computer. 

*Exercise 11 Materials*

Double-click the index file in the Help folder and click the ConsoleCards link in the pane on the left; this is the documentation for the classes I provided to you in the ConsoleCards dll.

Open the solution in Visual Studio.

### Problem 1 - Create objects

Because you'll be using the classes in the ConsoleCards namespace from the dll I added to the project, I added a using directive for that namespace at the top of the Program.cs file.

Inside the Main method, declare a deck variable and create a new Deck object for that variable.

Inside the Main method, declare an array variable that will hold 5 cards and create a new array object for that variable.

Tell the deck to shuffle itself.

### Problem 2 - Add card to the array, flip it over, and print it

Take a card from the top of the deck and add it to element 0 in the array.

Flip the card at element 0 of the array over.

Tell the card at element 0 of the array to print itself.

### Problem 3 - Add another card to the array, flip it over, and print both cards

Take a card from the top of the deck and add it to element 1 in the array.

Flip the card at element 1 of the array over.

Tell the cards at elements 0 and 1 of the array to print themselves.
