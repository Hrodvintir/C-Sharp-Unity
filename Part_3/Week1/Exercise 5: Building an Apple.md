# Exercise 5: Building an Apple

Although this exercise isn't worth any points, it gives you valuable programming experience. You're almost definitely going to have to complete the exercises to succeed in the course.

### The Problem

Implement the constructor for the Apple class weâ€™ve been working on in the previous two exercises. Remember, the constructor parameters should be whether or not the apple is organic and how large the apple is (which will be my initial value for how much is left to eat).

Add code to your Main method to instantiate an Apple object and access the properties to ensure the constructor and properties are working correctly.
