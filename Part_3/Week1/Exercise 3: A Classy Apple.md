# Exercise 3: A Classy Apple

Although this exercise isn't worth any points, it gives you valuable design experience. You're almost definitely going to have to complete the exercises to succeed in the course.

### The Problem

Develop an abstraction for a console app apple that the Main method wants to eat. The Main method likes all kind of apples, but it doesn’t like to ingest pesticides or other non-organic materials. Of course, once the apple is gone the Main method doesn’t want to keep trying to eat it!

Start by figuring out the details that matter for this abstraction. After you’ve done that, figure out the fields, properties, and methods your Apple class should implement. If you want to, you could even draw a UML class diagram of your Apple class.

### Note

The next few exercises will implement the design from this exercise.
