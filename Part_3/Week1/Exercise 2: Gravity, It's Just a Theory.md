# Exercise 2: Gravity, It's Just a Theory

Although this exercise isn't worth any points, it gives you valuable programming experience. You're almost definitely going to have to complete the exercises to succeed in the course.

### Getting Started

Download the zip file below and unzip the file somewhere on your computer. Do NOT look at the Apple.cs file yet!

### Problem 1 - Determine abstraction for the apple

In this game, the apple is supposed to provide health to the player (Newton) when the player collides with the apple. Decide what details are important for the apple for this problem.

### Problem 2 - Implement the apple abstraction

Add the Apple.cs file from the zip file to the Scripts folder and attach it to the Apple prefab. Open the Apple script to see the field and property I implemented for the apple abstraction for this problem.

### Problem 3 - Add code to Newton

Add code to the Newton script to add the amount of health the apple provides and print out the new health to the Console window when Newton collides with an apple. Destroy the apple as well.

Remember, you can use the GetComponent method to get a reference to a script attached to a game object.
