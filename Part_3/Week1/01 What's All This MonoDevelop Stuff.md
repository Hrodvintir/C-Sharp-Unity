# What's All This MonoDevelop Stuff

When I originally recorded the videos in this course, Unity shipped with MonoDevelop, not Visual Studio (which wasn't available on Mac at that time). Since Visual Studio is now available on both Windows and Mac, and since Unity now ships with Visual Studio, not MonoDevelop, we'll be using Visual Studio throughout the course.

I'm in the process of re-recording all the videos using Visual Studio and a more recent version of Unity, but that will take some time to complete. In the meantime, many of the videos are in MonoDevelop until I can get them replaced. The good news is that the C# programming language is the same no matter what Integrated Development Environment you use to develop your code, so all the key ideas are the same in both Visual Studio and MonoDevelop.
