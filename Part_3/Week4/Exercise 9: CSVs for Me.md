# Exercise 9: CSVs for Me

Although this exercise isn't worth any points, it gives you valuable programming experience. You're almost definitely going to have to complete the exercises to succeed in the course.

These problems are based on something my company implemented in Second Life to place blocks into slots in a pyramid.

Note: All the variables you use in this program should be the appropriate data types for the data you're storing in them. 

### Problem 1 – Extracting the Pyramid Slot Number

Create a new console application named Exercise9.

Read in a string from the user in the following format:

<pyramid slot number>,<block letter>,<whether or not the block should be lit>

Example:

15,M,true

Use the String methods you can read about in the documentation to extract the pyramid slot number from the string and store it in a variable.

Print the pyramid slot number. This is a number, so you should NOT be saving it as a string!

### Problem 2 – Extracting the Block Letter

Extract the block letter from the string and store it in a variable.

Print the block letter. This is a single character, so you should NOT be saving it as a string!

### Problem 3 – Extracting Whether Or Not the Block Should Be Lit

Extract whether or not the block should be lit from the string and store it in a variable. This is a Boolean value, so you should NOT be saving it as a string!

You are NOT allowed to use the LastIndexOf method to do this. (Hint: Use the Substring method to shorten the original input string)

Print whether or not the block should be lit.
