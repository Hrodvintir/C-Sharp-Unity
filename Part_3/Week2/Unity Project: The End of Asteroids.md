# Unity Project: The End of Asteroids

### Unity Projects

In previous versions of this course, this Unity project was a required, graded, peer reviewed assignment. Unfortunately, the peer review process became unworkable for this project.  

I strongly encourage you to complete this project. It gives you good experience developing a Unity game using the concepts youâ€™ve learned in this and previous modules (and courses).

### Project Description

You're finally finishing the simplified version of the classic arcade game Asteroids. This is the final increment in your development of this game, so when you're done with this project you'll be done with the game!

In this project, you're making bullets split larger asteroids into smaller asteroids, making bullets destroy asteroids that are small enough, adding a timer to the game, and adding sound effects to the game.

### Why do we care?

Because it's cool to actually build a real game, even a simple one! This project is the final increment in your implementation of a simplified version of Asteroids.

### Starting the Assignment

Download the zip file below and unzip the file somewhere on your computer.

The zip file contains a number of useful materials.

### Implementation Steps

 I used my solution to the Unity project from the previous module as my starting point for this project; I've included that solution in the zip file above.

I've provided detailed step-by-step instructions in the zip file above for you to follow if you'd like to have a "guided development experience" for this project.

Of course, you're also welcome to implement your solution without following those instructions, but you still need to implement all the required functionality for the project. Specifically, your solution needs to:

 - Make bullets split asteroids into two smaller asteroids

 - Make bullets destroy asteroids that are less than half the original size

 - Add a game timer that displays how long the player has been playing

 - Stop the game timer when the ship is destroyed

 - Play sound effects when the player shoots a bullet, when a bullet collides with an asteroid, and when the ship is destroyed

### Testing Your Game

Here are the rubrics we used in previous versions of the course to confirm that the game functioned correctly:

 - Bullets split asteroids into two smaller asteroids

 - Bullets destroy asteroids that are less than half the original size

 - A game timer displays how long the player has been playing

 - The game timer stops when the ship is destroyed

 - The game plays sound effects when the player shoots a bullet, when a bullet collides with an asteroid, and when the ship is destroyed
