# Unity Project: Wacky Breakout Increment 2

### Unity Projects

In previous versions of this course, this Unity project was a required, graded, peer reviewed assignment. Unfortunately, the peer review process became unworkable for this project.  

I strongly encourage you to complete this project. It gives you good experience developing a Unity game using the concepts youâ€™ve learned in this and previous modules (and courses).

### Project Description

For this project, you're continuing your work on your Wacky Breakout game.

As a reminder, a more detailed requirements specification for the game is included below; you should definitely download and read it.

You won't actually complete the full version of the game until the end of the following course, but game developers typically break their game development into a number of increments. This project is the second increment in your development of this game.

In this project, you'll add the following functionality:

 - Let the player destroy blocks by hitting them with the ball

 - The game will automatically build 3 rows of standard blocks

 - Balls that disappear after their lifetime expires and balls that leave the screen are destroyed and replaced with a new ball

 - Newly-spawned balls (and the original ball) will delay for approximately 1 second before they start moving

In addition to replacing balls that expired or left the screen, new balls will be spawned randomly every 5 to 10 seconds

### Why do we care?

Because this project is the second increment in your implementation of Wacky Breakout, and it lets you use what you've learned in this and the previous Specialization courses.

### Starting the Assignment

Download the zip file below and unzip the file somewhere on your computer.

The zip file contains a variety of useful resources for you to use on this project.

### Implementation Steps

I've provided detailed step-by-step instructions in the zip file above for you to follow if you'd like to have a "guided development experience" for this project, though the steps aren't as detailed as those I provided for Wacky Breakout Increment 1.

Of course, you're also welcome to implement your solution without following those instructions, but you still need to implement all the required functionality for the project. Specifically, your solution needs to meet the requirements listed in the Project Description above.

### Testing Your Game

Here are some rubrics you can use to confirm that the game functions correctly:

 - Row of blocks is provided in the game, with the ball destroying blocks it hits

 - Balls disappear after a reasonable period of time and are replaced with a new ball

 - When a ball leaves the bottom of the screen it's replaced with a new ball

 - New balls are spawned every 5-10 seconds (in addition to the replacement balls from criteria 2 and 3) and newly-spawned balls delay approximately 1 second before starting to move
