# Practice Programming Assignment: Nom Nom Nom

### Assignment Description  

Learning about abstraction and developing an Apple class (in the exercises) really made you hungry -- but for eggs, not apples.

In this assignment, you'll implement an Egg console app class.

### Why do we care?

Because you should get more practice developing constructors, properties, and methods in your own console app class.

### Getting Started

Download the appropriate zip file for your OS below and unzip the file somewhere on your computer.

Open the project in Visual Studio.

Important: You MUST only add code as indicated by the comments in that file. If you don't, you're virtually guaranteed to fail all the test cases in the automated grader.

### Requirements

For this assignment, you need to implement an Egg class as shown in the class diagram below:

The Visual Studio project I provided to you contains the Egg class (with the constructor, properties, and method bodies unimplemented) and a Program class that tests the Egg class. You shouldn't change the Program.cs file at all (if you do, you'll break the automated grader), all your work in this assignment is in the Egg.cs file.

I've also included two enumerations in the project: one for the color of the egg and one for how the egg is cooked. You shouldn't change those files either.

The constructor (not shown in the class diagram, but included in the Egg class I provided) should initialize the amountLeft and color fields based on the constructor parameters. I've already initialized the howCooked field in the code I provided. 

Hint: You'll have to use this to set the color properly because the field and the parameter are both called color. Don't change the field or parameter name, learn how to use this!

The AmountLeft property should return the value of the amountLeft field.

The Color property should return the value of the color field.

The CookedStatus property should return the value of the howCooked field.

The IsCooked property should return true if the egg is cooked and false if the egg isn't cooked. You should be able to figure out how to use the value of the howCooked field to return the appropriate bool from this property..

The Cook method changes the howCooked field using the howToCook parameter. Once an egg has been cooked, it can't be cooked again.

The Dye method changes the color field using the color parameter. Only white eggs can be dyed, and they can only be dyed blue.

Hint: you'll have to use this to set the color properly because the field and the parameter are both called color. Don't change the field or parameter name, learn how to use this!

The TakeBite method changes the amountLeft field based on the size parameter. The value of the amountLeft field should never go below 0.

The best approach is to implement the constructor and the AmountLeft and Color properties first (to pass test case 1), then implement the Cook method and the CookedStatus property (to pass test case 2), and so on.

### Required Output Format

The Program.cs file I provided handles all the output correctly. It simply prints Passed or FAILED for each test case that's selected by the user input.

### Running Your Code

Because of the code I included to work with the automated grader on Coursera, when you run your program the command prompt window will open and it will sit there doing nothing. To make your code run, type in a test case number (1 through 10, inclusive) and press the <Enter> key; your code should then run so you can check your output. 

For example, your input could be
```
3
```
to run the third test case.

You can actually run your code again if you want to by typing in a test case number and pressing the <Enter> key again. When youâ€™re ready to stop running your code, type q (for quit).

Here's what running the code multiple times with different inputs should look like (though none of your test cases should fail!). The first line is the test case number, the second line is your output line, and so on:  
```
1

Passed

2

FAILED

q
```
Important Note: The Coursera formatting makes it look like there's a blank line between each of the lines above, but there's not. The above output should be exactly 5 lines of input/output.

The image below shows my console window when I run the code multiple times as described above:
  
  ![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/prT-2eKZQUi0_tnimYFIGA_210e7b039e14a40b80b730b3f245760a_Programming-Assignment-2-Multiple-Runs.png?expiry=1643155200000&hmac=-OHsRSSav4wBh_ymsGvfL-vUTHBV_Ymg5tnEYxl1k-k)
  
 If your output doesn't match the image above EXACTLY (no extra words, characters, spaces, or blank lines) you'll fail all the test cases in the automated grader. Of course, you shouldn't get any FAILED output when you run your code!

Mac users: You may or may not have an extra blank line after the q. That's fine.  

### Test Case Inputs

The automated grader uses the set of test cases that are built into the Program.cs file I provided to you.

### Common Problems

Historically, lots of people post about grading errors on this assignment (because their code is wrong). Here are a couple things you should check:

You have to start with the Visual Studio project I gave you in the assignment materials and add your code to the appropriate places in the Egg class. The code I gave you includes the appropriate structure for the automated grader to work. If you don't do this, you'll almost definitely fail all the test cases in the automated grader

I give you an example in this assignment (and all assignments) for what output you should get when you run the code multiple times. Be sure to try that example; if your code doesn't generate output exactly as shown in the example, your code isn't working properly    

### Submitting Your Solution

Go to the programming assignment on Coursera and click My submission near the top (next to Instructions). Click the + Create submission button, click the blue button on the left, upload your Egg.cs file, and click the Submit button. If the Honor Code popup appears, click the check box, fill in your name if necessary, and click the Continue button. Then wait patiently while the automated grader grades your assignment!

Important: In the past, you've usually submitted your Program.cs file in previous programming assignments; DON'T DO THAT! You need to submit your Egg.cs file for this assignment.

### What Is The Automated Grader Telling Me?

If you post about getting errors from the automated grader, be sure to include a screenshot of the grader feedback. You can get to that feedback by clicking the Show grader output link in the Passed? column, then clicking the View grader feedback link that appears when you do that. You'll know you're in the right place when all the characters are either green or red.

### What If I Upload the Wrong File?

If you upload the wrong file, you'll almost definitely get compilation errors. The most common mistake people make is uploading the .sln file; if you do that, you'll get something like the following: 
  
  ![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/hWPCagG8SGGjwmoBvFhh8Q_4ed4b7a62ab34228a316597281a59d97_Solution-File-Uploaded-Error.png?expiry=1643155200000&hmac=e5MQhUiwIFFK8uSoN6GtCeGv2519VYJHmfc6OyUFAz0)
  
  If that happens, go back and upload the correct file.

Which Posts Will Dr. T Respond To?

I'm happy to try to help people solve problems they're having, but I'll only do that if you provide the appropriate information in your initial post. If you're getting a grader error, you have to provide both the screenshot of the grader feedback and a screenshot of your code running multiple times (as shown above) on your local computer, including the Press any key message at the end. That Press any key message is important, so be sure to include it.
