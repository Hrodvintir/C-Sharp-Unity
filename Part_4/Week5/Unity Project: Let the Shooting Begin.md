# Unity Project: Let the Shooting Begin

### Unity Projects

In previous versions of this course, this Unity project was a required, graded, peer reviewed assignment. Unfortunately, the peer review process became unworkable for this project.  

I strongly encourage you to complete this project. It gives you good experience developing a Unity game using the concepts you’ve learned in this and previous modules (and courses).

### Project Description  

You're still building the simplified version of the classic arcade game Asteroids. You won't actually complete the full version of the game until next week, but game developers typically break their game development into a number of increments. This project is the fourth increment in your development of this game; you're almost there!

In this project, you're adding bullets to the game.  

### Why do we care?

Because it's cool to actually build a real game, even a simple one! This project is the fourth increment in your implementation of a simplified version of Asteroids, and we only have one more increment to go after this one.

The zip file contains a number of useful materials. 

### Implementation Steps

I used my solution to the Unity project from the previous module as my starting point for this project; I've included that solution in the zip file above.

I've provided detailed step-by-step instructions in the zip file above for you to follow if you'd like to have a "guided development experience" for this project.

Of course, you're also welcome to implement your solution without following those instructions, but you still need to implement all the required functionality for the project. Specifically, your solution needs to:

 - Have the ship shoot bullets in the direction the ship is facing

 - Make sure the ship doesn't collide with bullets

 - Make bullets destroy asteroids

 - Make bullets destroy themselves after 2 seconds

 - Make bullets screen wrap

 - Make it so bullets don't collide with each other

### Testing Your Game

Here are the rubrics we used in previous versions of the course to confirm that the game functioned correctly:

 - Bullets fire in the direction the ship is facing (close is good enough for this, perfection isn’t required)  

 - Bullets don’t destroy the ship

 - Bullets destroy asteroid

 - Bullets are removed after approximately 2 second

 - Bullets screen wrap properly
