# Exercise S8: Yer Birthday

Although this exercise isn't worth any points, it gives you valuable programming experience. You're almost definitely going to have to complete the exercises to succeed in the course.

### Problem 1 – Birthday Fun

Create a new console application named Exercise8. Your program will read in a user’s birthday as a month (January, February, etc.) followed by the day and echo that information to the user. 

Start by prompting for and getting the month of the user’s birthday

 - Print an appropriate message to the user asking for their birth month

 - Read the value from the user

 - Store the value in an appropriate variable

Next, prompt for and get the day of the user’s birthday

 - Print an appropriate message to the user asking for their birth day

 - Read the value from the user

 - Convert (Parse) the value as appropriate. You should NOT be storing the day as a \tt{string}string!

 - Store the value in an appropriate variable

Finally, print out the stored values to the user with an appropriate message

### Problem 2 – Reminders

Add code to display what day a reminder email will be sent to the user inviting them to visit an in-game store on their birthday for 20% off.  Your program must display that the reminder will be sent on the day before the user’s birthday. 

Specifically, your additional code should print a message to the user stating the month and day they will receive a reminder (see Hint below).

Hint:  What if the user puts in the first day of the month (e.g., July 1)?  What value will your application print?  This is a bug!  We won't worry about that here as we practice with strings, so leave the bug and ignore the problem.
