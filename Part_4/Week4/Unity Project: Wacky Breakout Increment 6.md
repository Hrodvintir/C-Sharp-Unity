# Unity Project: Wacky Breakout Increment 6

### Unity Projects

In previous versions of this course, this Unity project was a required, graded, peer reviewed assignment. Unfortunately, the peer review process became unworkable for this project.  

I strongly encourage you to complete this project. It gives you good experience developing a Unity game using the concepts you’ve learned in this and previous modules (and courses).

### Project Description

For this project, you're finishing on your Wacky Breakout game. After this project, you’ll final have a full version of the game. As a reminder, a more detailed requirements specification for the game is included below; you should definitely download and read it.

In this project, you'll make the following changes and add the following functionality:

 - Add the menu system to the game

 - Add the game over message to the game

 - Add sound effects to the game

### Why do we care?

Because this project is the final increment in your implementation of Wacky Breakout, and that means you'll be done implementing the full game!

The zip file contains a variety of useful resources for you to use on this project.  

### Implementation Steps

I've provided detailed step-by-step instructions in the zip file above for you to follow if you'd like to have a "guided development experience" for this project.

Of course, you're also welcome to implement your solution without following those instructions, but you still need to implement all the required functionality for the assignment. Specifically, your solution needs to meet the requirements listed in the Project Description above.

### Testing Your Game

Here are some rubrics you can use to confirm that the game functions correctly:

 - The quit button on the main menu exits the game. You'll have to build and run your game to test this functionality

 - The help button on the main menu leads to a help menu. The help menu includes a back button that returns the player to the main menu

 - The play button on the main menu leads to a difficulty menu with easy, medium, and hard buttons. Clicking any of those buttons starts the game play

 - Pressing the escape key during game play pauses the game and displays the pause menu. The resume button unpauses the game and resumes the game and the quit button returns the player to the main menu

 - The game over message is displayed when last ball is lost

 - The required sound effects, including menu button clicks, are played in the game
