# Unity Project: Wacky Breakout Increment 4

### Unity Projects

In previous versions of this course, this Unity project was a required, graded, peer reviewed assignment. Unfortunately, the peer review process became unworkable for this project.  

I strongly encourage you to complete this project. It gives you good experience developing a Unity game using the concepts you’ve learned in this and previous modules (and courses).

### Project Description

For this project, you're continuing your work on your Wacky Breakout game.

As a reminder, a more detailed requirements specification for the game is included below; you should definitely download and read it.

You won't actually complete the full version of the game until the end of this course, but game developers typically break their game development into a number of increments. This project is the second increment in your development of this game.

In this project, you'll add the following functionality:

 - Bonus blocks included in the game

 - Freezer and speedup effect blocks included in the game

 - Standard, bonus, freezer, and speedup blocks included in the level based on probabilities from the configuration data file

 - The score should increase by 1 point when a Standard block is destroyed, 2 points when a Bonus block is destroyed, and 5 points when a Freezer or Speedup block is destroyed. These point values should be stored in and used from the configuration data file

 - The Freezer and Speedup blocks should NOT implement their freezing and speeding up functionality; that will come in the next increment

### Why do we care?

Because this project is the fourth increment in your implementation of Wacky Breakout, and it lets you use what you've learned in the previous specialization courses and what you've learned in this module (hint: you should have a Block class hierarchy to account for the differences in the block behavior in the game even though the effect blocks don’t implement their full functionality yet).

### Starting the Assignment

Download the zip file below and unzip the file somewhere on your computer.

The zip file contains a variety of useful resources for you to use on this project.

### Implementation Steps

I've provided detailed step-by-step instructions in the zip file above for you to follow if you'd like to have a "guided development experience" for this project, though the steps aren't as detailed as those I provided for previous Wacky Breakout increments.

Of course, you're also welcome to implement your solution without following those instructions, but you still need to implement all the required functionality for the project. Specifically, your solution needs to meet the requirements listed in the Project Description above.

### Testing Your Game

Here are some rubrics you can use to confirm that the game functions correctly:

1. Game includes standard, bonus, freezer, and speedup blocks with the appropriate probabilities

2. The score increases by 1 point when a Standard block is destroyed, 2 points when a Bonus block is destroyed, and 5 points when a Freezer or Speedup block is destroyed
