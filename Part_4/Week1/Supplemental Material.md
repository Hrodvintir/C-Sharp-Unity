# Supplemental Material

I recently restructured the C# Programming for Unity Game Development Specialization, changing the pace and content in the courses in the Specialization and making this the final course in the Specialization. That means that some learners might have missed some of the material in the previous courses based on the course and Specialization they were currently enrolled in when the new versions of the courses and the new version of the Specialization went live. I've provided a Supplemental Material module at the end of the course containing all the course materials you might have missed if that happened to you.

Even though that material is marked as Week 5, none of that material is graded. This really is a four-week course.
