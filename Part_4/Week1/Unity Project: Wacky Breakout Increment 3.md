# Unity Project: Wacky Breakout Increment 3

### Unity Projects

In previous versions of this course, this Unity project was a required, graded, peer reviewed assignment. Unfortunately, the peer review process became unworkable for this project.  

I strongly encourage you to complete this project. It gives you good experience developing a Unity game using the concepts youâ€™ve learned in this and previous modules (and courses).

### Project Description

For this project, you're continuing your work on your Wacky Breakout game.

As a reminder, a more detailed requirements specification for the game is included below; you should definitely download and read it.

You won't actually complete the full version of the game until the end of the course, but game developers typically break their game development into a number of increments. This project is the second increment in your development of this game.

In this project, you'll add the following functionality:

 - Use configuration data from a configuration data file throughout your game

 - A HUD that keeps track of and displays how many balls the player has left 

 - A HUD that keeps track of and displays the player's current score

### Why do we care?

Because this project is the third increment in your implementation of Wacky Breakout, and it lets you use what you've learned in this and the previous Specialization courses.

### Starting the Assignment

Download the zip file below and unzip the file somewhere on your computer.

The zip file contains a variety of useful resources for you to use on this project.

I've provided detailed step-by-step instructions in the zip file above for you to follow if you'd like to have a "guided development experience" for this project, though the steps aren't as detailed as those I provided for Wacky Breakout Increment 1.

Of course, you're also welcome to implement your solution without following those instructions, but you still need to implement all the required functionality for the project. Specifically, your solution needs to meet the requirements listed in the Project Description above.

### Testing Your Game

Here are some rubrics you can use to confirm that the game functions correctly:

1. Game uses configuration data from a configuration data file

2. HUD accurately displays the number of balls the player has left

3. The row of blocks now has a random assortment of the standard block sprites

4. HUD accurately displays the player's current score
