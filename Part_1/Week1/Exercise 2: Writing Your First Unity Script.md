Although this exercise isn't worth any points, it gives you valuable programming experience. You're almost definitely going to have to complete the exercises to succeed in the course.

### Problem â€“ Output your favorite three games

 Use Unity Hub to create a new 2D Unity project named Exercise2. Change the name of SampleScene to Scene0. Add a Scripts folder and add a new C# script named PrintFavoriteGames. Open the script, fill in the comment near the top of the script, and delete the Update method. Next, add code to the Start method to output the names of your three favorite games. Attach the script to the Main Camera in the scene and run the game to see the output in the Console window.
