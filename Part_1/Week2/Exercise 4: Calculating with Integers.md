# Exercise 4: Calculating with Integers
Although this exercise isn't worth any points, it gives you valuable programming experience. You're almost definitely going to have to complete the exercises to succeed in the course.

### Problem â€“ Calculating with integers

Create a new C# Console App named Exercise4.

In the Main method, do the following:

Prompt for and get the altitude for a location as an int.

Prompt for and get the altitude for a second location as an int.

Calculate and display the altitude change you'd experience moving from the first point to the second point.

Hint: The order of the subtraction matters, so make sure you're getting the correct sign on your answer.

### Prompting for and Getting

To prompt for an input, you could use something like:

```Console.Write("Enter first altitude: ");```

To read, parse, and store an altitude typed in by the user, you could use something like: 

```int firstAltitude = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());```
