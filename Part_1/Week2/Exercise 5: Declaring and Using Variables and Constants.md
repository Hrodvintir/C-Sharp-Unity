# Exercise 5: Declaring and Using Variables and Constants
Although this exercise isn't worth any points, it gives you valuable programming experience. You're almost definitely going to have to complete the exercises to succeed in the course.

### Problem â€“ Declaring and Using Constants and Variables

Create a new 2D Unity project named Exercise5. Change the name of SampleScene to Scene0. Add a Scripts folder and add a new C# script named PrintPercent. 

Open the script, fill in the comment near the top of the script, and delete the Update method. Add the following code to the Start method:

 - Declare a constant named MaxScore of type int and assign it a value of 100.

 - Declare a variable named score of type int and assign it a value between 0 and 100.

 - Declare a variable named percent of type float and store the percent calculated by dividing score by MaxScore. Remember how integer division works in C# and use type casting as appropriate.

 - Print the percent in the Unity Console window. The percent you print should be between 0% and 100%.

Attach the script to the Main Camera in the scene and run the game to see the output in the Console window.
