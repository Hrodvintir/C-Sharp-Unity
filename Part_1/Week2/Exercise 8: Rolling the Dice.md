# Exercise 8: Rolling the Dice
Although this exercise isn't worth any points, it gives you valuable programming experience. You're almost definitely going to have to complete the exercises to succeed in the course.

### Getting Started

Download the zip file below and extract the file somewhere on your computer.

*Exercise 8 Materials - iCloud*

Double-click the index file in the Help folder and click the Exercise8 link in the pane on the left; this is the documentation for the Die class I provided to you in the Exercise8 solution. Note: You can't open the index file from within the zip file, you need to open it in the extracted (unzipped) location.

Open the Exercise8 solution in Visual Studio.

### Problem 1 - Create two dice

Declare die1 and die2 variables and use the appropriate Die constructor to put new six-sided Die objects into those variables.

Use the help documentation I provided to figure out which constructor to use.

### Problem 2 - Tell the dice to roll themselves

Tell the die1 and die2 variables to roll themselves. Use the help documentation I provided to figure out which method to use.

Side note: The solution I gave you includes a RandomNumberGenerator class that's initialized in the Main method and used by the Die class when a die rolls itself. It's pretty common to have a random number generator that's used by the whole "game".

### Problem 3 - Print the top sides of the two dice and print their sum

Print the top sides of the two dice. Use the help documentation I provided to figure out which property to use.

Print the sum of the top sides of the two dice.

Hint: It's easiest to declare a variable that holds the sum of the top sides of the two dice, then print that sum.
