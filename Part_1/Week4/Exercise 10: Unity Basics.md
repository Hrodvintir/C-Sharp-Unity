# Exercise 10: Unity Basics
Although this exercise isn't worth any points, it gives you valuable programming experience. You're almost definitely going to have to complete the exercises to succeed in the course.

### Problem 1 - Create a Unity project and add sprites

Create a new 2D Unity project named Exercise10. Rename SampleScene to Scene0. Add a Sprites folder to the Project window and use your OS to add any three sprites you want to that folder (I suggest you use png files, though Unity supports other file formats as well).

### Problem 2 - Add sprites to scene

Drag each of the sprites from the Sprites folder in the Project window onto the Hierarchy window. 

Adjust the Position X and Y values in the Transform component to place the new game objects in the scene in a reasonable way.

### Problem 3 - Run the game

Click the arrow facing to the right (the Play button) near the top center of the Unity Editor and check out your amazing game in the Game view!
